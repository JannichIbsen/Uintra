# Uintra - A social framework
A flexible and lightweight Umbraco based framework, for making an Intranet, Extranet or social platform based on known conventions.

## Why Open Source?
We are trying to create a flexible and robust social framework. We think the best way to achieve this is through an online community, that can share and iterate through ideas. In order to create a solution that has valuable functionality validated by the users.
