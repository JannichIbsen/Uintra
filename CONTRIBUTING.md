# Contributing to the Uintra framework

First of all, thank you! We are eager to see new contributions and we are very happy that you have taken an interest in Uintra.

In this section we will provide a set of guidelines for contributions to the Uintra framework. 
These guidelines are subject to change and suggestions are more than welcome!

When you send us your contribution we will do our very best to review and give you feedback as fast as possible. 
We expect to be able to reply to your pull request within 48 hours. In this reply we will let you know how long we will need to review your contribution and hopefully merge it!
Pull requests(PR)
When you make a PR we will group it in one of two different categories: Minor or Major.
The process for submitting either is pretty much the same however major PRs will require more time on our end to review. 

### Minor Pull Requests
Minor PRs include mainly bug fixes and smaller improvements. A minor PR involves only a small amount of changes. We will often be able to review and merge a minor PR if everything is in order.

### Major Pull Requests
Major PRs include new features and large refactorings. The major PR usually means a large number of changes, new files and updates to the package manager files (NuGet).
We will always strive to reply within 48 hours however depending on the content of the PR it may take a week or two before we have reviewed the PR and can provide proper feedback!

When submitting a major PR please include a description with necessary screenshots or the like to give us an understanding of what you have worked towards!

## Contribution details
Reporting Bugs
Most importantly, check if you can reproduce the problem in the latest version of Uintra. We might have already fixed your particular problem.
It also helps tremendously to check if the issue you're experiencing is present in a clean install of the Umbraco version you're currently using. Custom code can have side-effects that don't occur in a clean install.
Use the Google. Whatever you're experiencing, Google it plus "Umbraco" - usually you can get some pretty good hints from the search results, including open issues and further troubleshooting hints.

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem. We're listing the following hints to indicate that the most successful reports usually have a lot of this ground covered:
Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the problem.
Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem in as many details as possible. For example, start by explaining which steps you took in the backoffice to get to a certain undesirable result, e.g. you created a document type, inheriting 3 levels deep, added a certain data type, tried to save it and you got an error.
Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps. If you wrote some code, try to provide a code sample as specific as possible to be able to reproduce the behavior.
Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.
Can you reliably reproduce the issue? If not, provide details about how often the problem happens and under which conditions it normally happens.

Include details about your configuration and environment:
Which version of Uintra are you working on?
What is the environment you're using Uintra in? Is this a problem on your local machine or on a server. Tell us about your configuration: Windows version, IIS/IISExpress, database type, etc.
Which packages do you have installed?

When submitting a change to existing functionality please describe:
What existing functionality do you want to change
Why do you think it should be changed?
Describe the exact parts of the functionality you have changed
Describe how the changed functionality works after the changes compared to before.

When submitting completely new features please add a description of the new feature
Describe it shortly
Include screenshots and animated GIFs which help you demonstrate the steps or point out the part of Uintra the suggestion is related to.
Explain which users this enhancement would benefit and why.
