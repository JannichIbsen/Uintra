Uintra is an intranet framework based on popular social media conventions. It is built on Umbraco and offers
a large number of customisation options. Uintra allows your organisation to communicate and organise information
in an easy way.

The Uintra architecture has been implemented and tested with several big organisations in Denmark, and this is
the foundation for the available functionality. By establishing what the common needs are in relation to an
intranet and an extranet it was possible to create a basic package solution with all the basic necessities
required to make a lightweight intranet fast.

Uintra is a fully-featured, open source Intranet product, with its flexibility and great managing experience.
